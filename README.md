# card-table-in-c
I'll be challenging myself to make a meaningful commit to a project everyday for November. In this project, I'm going to recreate every card game I can think of in C because that's what I'm learning right now.

Nov 1: Today, I made the card_table.c file, the main function, and three other functions. The program greets the user and asks them what game they want to play. It will loop until the user inputs a valid option. Currently, War is the only valid option. Then, it creates a deck of cards and prints it. The value of the cards is working perfectly, but I couldn't get the suits working yet (the code compiles fine; the suits are just random characters right now). I designed the deck as a 52 x 2 matrix, where deck[card number][0] is the value of the card, and deck[card number][1] is the suit of the card. This is the only way I could think of doing this with my current C knowlege. My goals for tomorrow are to get the suits working, at least get a good start on War, commit more than once, and leave more comments inside the code.

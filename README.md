# card-table-in-c
I'll be challenging myself to make a meaningful commit to a project everyday for November. In this project, I'm going to recreate every card game I can think of in C because that's what I'm learning right now.

Nov 1: Today, I made the card_table.c file, the main function, and three other functions. The program greets the user and asks them what game they want to play. It will loop until the user inputs a valid option. Currently, War is the only valid option. Then, it creates a deck of cards and prints it. The value of the cards is working perfectly, but I couldn't get the suits working yet (the code compiles fine; the suits are just random characters right now). I designed the deck as a 52 x 2 matrix, where deck[card number][0] is the value of the card, and deck[card number][1] is the suit of the card. This is the only way I could think of doing this with my current C knowlege. My goals for tomorrow are to get the suits working, at least get a good start on War, commit more than once, and leave more comments inside the code.   

Nov 2: Pretty solid day today. I completed all of my goals from yesterday. The suits are working great (I had to replace the characters inside the arrays for just 0, 1, 2, and 3, which represent hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades respectively). I committed more than once, making sure that each time I did commit, the code was good and at least compiled. I added the shuffle_deck function, which shuffles the deck array and the split_deck function, which splits the shuffled deck into two hands, one for the player, and one for the opponent. I got a pretty good start to the war game; currently, it just compares each card in the same position in the 26 card hands and will give a win to whichever hand has the highest value card. Right now, it doesn't go beyond that. At the end, it tells you which player won. At this time, it can't handle ties, so it just gives the win to the opponent. I also added several more good comments explaining the logic of some functions and overall making the code more readable. My goal for tomorrow is to finish or at least get close to finishing war. 

Nov 3: Unfortunately, I did not have much time to work on this project today. However, I still got some stuff done. I got a good start on the war game; I added helper functions that will cycle through each player's hand, so the game can include the part where if you win, you get both the cards placed in that round. I changed the split_deck function, and now it will fill every spot in the 52 spot hand that doesn't get filled with a card with -1. The move_cards_up_in_hand function loops through every spot in a given hand except the last and sets each spot to the value of the spot that is directly after it. The last spot is just set to -1. This simulates removing the top card of a set of cards, where the second card will become the first, the third card will become the second, and so on. The add_cards_to_hand function takes in a hand of cards and another 2D array of cards ([2][2]), which represents the two cards that were placed down in a round of war and will be given to the winner of the round. The function loops through all of the cards in the given hand, and when it sees the first -1, it will repace that with the first card passed in the function, and it will do the same for the second -1 it finds. This represents taking the cards you won when you win a round and putting them at the bottom of your hand. Right now, the main game while loop is looping infinitely, so my main goal for tomorrow is to just do some debugging, find out why it's an infinite loop, and fix it. Hopefully, I can also implement ties tomorrow.    

Nov 4: Today, I finished up the war game. I added the check_amount_of_cards function, which takes in a hand of cards, loops through them until it finds a spot in the array filled with -1, representing the spot after the last card in the hand. When it finds that position, it returns that position because that position also represents the total amount of cards in the given hand. That is because every filled spot is always in the front due to the main loop always moving cards to the front with the move_cards_up_in_hand function. I used this function to fix the infinite loop problem. I also added the war_tie function, which has three parts. The first part exists to initialize the prize_cards matrix, representing the three cards each player places down when their cards tie in the normal round. It loops three times; each time it loops, it checks if each hand has more than one card, and if it does, it adds the first card from the hand to prize_cards. Each time the more-than-one-card check fails, a variable, cards_not_filled, is incremented. The second part of the function loops the amount of times cards_not_filled is equal to and fills the rest of the [6][2] prize_cards matrix with -1. The third part of the function checks to see what the outcome of the war is; if the player or opponent won, it returns that fact as an integer. If they tie, (again) the function just calls itself again, which represents a double war or double tie in the real game. I also moved everything associated with war to its own function called war, with the main function calling it. This makes the main function much cleaner. Now, the main function is a loop that will ask the user what game they want to play forever until they quit by entering 0. I also added max_turns. When war is chosen, the main function will ask what the max turn limit should be. When they user answers, it inputs it into the war function along with the deck to be used, and the game starts. If the game makes it to the max turn limit, it just ends, and whoever has the most wins overall will win the game. My goal for tomorrow is to make war's prints more aesthetically pleasing and helpful.
